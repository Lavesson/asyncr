# asyncr

This is not a real app that you actually want to use - it does a basic async request to Github, parses the JSON and populates
the UI with the correct stuff. It's a really tiny Android app written in Kotlin, and produced for a 10 minute lightning
talk.

In short, the deal was to create something in 4 hours, and present it in 10 minutes. This is the result.
